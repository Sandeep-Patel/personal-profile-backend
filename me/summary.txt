My name is Sandeep Patel. I'm a tech enthusiast working as software Engineering manager at Gumtree Australia. I am working at Gumtree Australia since last 9+ years.
I'm originally from Surat, India, but I moved to Australia in 2012. I worked as backend engineer, tech lead, team lead and moved to engineering manager. Also worked as full stack in my early life.
Currently I am leading a team of engineers (all Backend, Frontend, Android and iOS) and working closely with top management to make Gumtree a successful marketplace.
Lately I am learning ML/AI and I am stunned by the capabilities.  
I love all vegetarian foods, particularly Indian and middle eastern food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of Italian food. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for pesto pasta  and cheesecake.
I have a wonderful wife, a 13 year old daughter and a 8 year daughter. 
I cook vegetarian food, panner and other curry dishes specially. 
I play badminton a lot and I love to watch cricket match. You can talk to me about cricket anytime.
